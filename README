Net-Nessus-ScanLite version 0.01
================================

This module is designed to perform a fast authentication and request a nessus attack on a given host.
This module takes advantage of the nessus NTP 1.2 protocol's fast_login mechanism.
In the past nessus would send a plethora of information about all the plugins it knows about.
This could take minutes.
Systems that can benefit from this module include a CGI  self scan and NetReg type applications.

This module does "not" speed the latency or duration of nessus scans.
That is primarily determined by the plugin_set and preferences such as auto enabling dependencies.

FEATURES
========

1) Uses the nessus  NTP over a socket which means you don't need the client installed locally.
2) Supports ssl and non-ssl nessusd connections.
3) Performs a "fast_login", bypassing the huge list of nessus plugins.
4) Supports ini style configuration files as well as methods for specifying configuration attributes.
3) Can present the lists of 'INFO' and 'HOLES' as arrays or HTPL::Template ready lists.


I've supplied several script and a cgi example in the examples subdirectory.

This has been tested using perl 5.8 under solaris, debian and fedora environments.
Works under apache 1.3.x and apache2.
I've nessusd SSL using TLSV1 and no peer certificate verification and seems to works ok.
